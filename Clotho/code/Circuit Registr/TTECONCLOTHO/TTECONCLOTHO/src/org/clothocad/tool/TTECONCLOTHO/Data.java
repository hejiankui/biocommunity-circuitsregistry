In addition, they have metal binding domain in outer surface and bacteriorhodopsin. When we open light at the metal source, they start to move toward metal source and catch the metal atoms. Then we open the light at the destination while closing the light at the source. So our machines move toward the destination. After the arrival our machines will be exposed to light with specific wavelength to activate bacteriorhodopsin leading to small local pH changing at the outer surface. This pH changing causes the release of metal atoms from the metal binding domain. Eventually, system starts from the beginning and so on.",

		"Microorganisms typically prefer to utilize glucose over other sugar carbon sources such as xylose.  In E. coli, the xylose metabolism operon is controlled by both the xylose-inducible XylR activator protein and the cAMP receptor protein (CRP). In this project they attempt to eliminate glucose control over xylose-inducible gene expression in E. coli by altering the natural transcriptional control region of the xylose operon. Designs constructed and tested include scrambling the CRP binding site, increasing the strength of the xyl promoter, and overexpressing XylR. Xylose-inducible gene expression that functions independently of glucose regulation provides a useful approach to improving microbial utilization of biomass feedstocks containing mixtures of glucose and xylose.",

Such mechanism can be easily assembled and incorporated into bacteria through the use of biobricks.",

		"Our bio-thermometer is an E.coli that changes color at different temperatures. Such a biological thermometer can for example be applied as a temperature reporter system in large-scale fermentations, or as a temperature-inducible protein production system. A class of known biological temperature sensitive switches are called RNA thermometers. Below a certain temperature, the secondary structure of an RNA thermometer masks the Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence in a hairpin. Above this temperature the hairpin opens up, allowing the ribosome to bind . The input temperature is then converted to a color output by switching on the isoprenoid bio-synthetic pathway. ",
