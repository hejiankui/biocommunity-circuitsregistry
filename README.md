=============================

3Miao BioCommunity is a Synthetic Biology Community for people to find, perfect and share their ideas. And the theme of our community is Mind Map, a excellent way to expand peopleâ€™s mind and organize ideas. Mind Map also is a structure to connect all the ideas of users in our community. If users have any problem about their ideas and need someone to have a discussion, they can use live chats system and contact someone with a similar idea. When having a clear idea, people can use logical genetic designer to edit gene circuits and check the theoretical genetic relationship. It is a good way to modify their ideas and confirm the protocol of the project. So 3Miao BioCommunity is helpful for people to come up ideas and realize them.
