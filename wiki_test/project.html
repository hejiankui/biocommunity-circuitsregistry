					<h2>Overview</h2>
					<p>Our project, 3 Miao BioCommunity, is different from all the iGem software projects in the past, for we have an ambition to create a community for the whole synthetic biology. This community is based on our original idea, the Mind Road. Mind Road is a net structural mind map that can help users think and share ideas, which can function as a platform for all synthetic biology ideas exchange. </p>
					<p>Based on the Mind Road, our community now has a theme—— share ideas. With this theme, we intend to build our 3Miao BioCommunity. In this community, we offer LGD and TTEC as useful tool for users to process the ideas. LGD is a genetic circuit designer which can present the logical relationship of related parts. What is more, users can also post their own ideas and comment on others’ work, like Facebook and Twitter.</p>
					<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
					<p>Before we got our idea, we had reviewed all the software projects of the last three years and classified them into 6 categories (fig1). As showing in the picture, designing CAD takes up the majority of these projects. As expected, most of them share the similar ideas. After a certain time of thinking, we found that it is really reasonable that iGem software projects can hardly be quite innovative, for the lack of professional knowledge and the limitation of the usage of software during synthetic biology study. But also, if we continue to follow these ideas, our project is far away from being creative or original. Then it occurred to us, why don’t we write a program to help at least the wet lab members to get new ideas? Thus, we decided to make a difference, to create our own Mind Road—— a net structural mind map—— to assist either iGEMers or professional synthetic biology researchers to come up with and share their ideas.</p>
					<p>Even though the mind map idea is good, it is not good enough. What’s more, comparing with computer software, synthetic biology lacks such community for knowledge and skills exchange, like GitHub. So setting Mind Road as the theme, we decided to take a bold step, to establish a simple and free online platform with high interaction ability intended for everyone interested in synthetic biology.</p>
					<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
					<h3>Mind Road</h3>
					<p>A useful net structural mind map to help users know what the existing synthetic biology projects and what else they can do.</p>
					<h3>LGD</h3>
					<p>Short for logical genetic designer, LGD is a genetic circuit CAD that can present the detail information of the engineering bacteria and “calculate” the relationship of related parts based on our database.</p>
					<h3>TTEC</h3>
					<p>TTEC is the abbreviation of Transcriptional Terminator Efficiency Calculator. It is the last year’s project of SUSTC and can calculate the efficiency of a terminator. TTEC plays an important role of building up our synthetic biology community in the future.</p>

					<h2 id="application">Application</h2>
					<p>We want to establish a user-friendly web2.0 platform which can function as both a handy tool kit and a community. There are mainly 3 reasons that we choose a webpage instead of a native application. First, current software need to users don’t need to download our software. Second, a webpage is not limited with the system, which means users can log in our webpage wherever they can reach the internet. And the last, all the information can be stored by the cloud, so users don’t have to worry about their information being lost.
