							<h2>Recruiment</h2>
							<p>SUSTC-Shenzhen B had its new recruitment. About 70 freshmen readily started their iGEM journey.</p>

							<h2>Winter learning</h2>
							<p>During the winter holiday, we are separated in several groups to prepare for the Journal Club. When back to school in March, each group were supposed to give a presentation of what they had learned during the winter holiday every Monday and Thursday. In this way, we cooperated to learn basic knowledge of synthetic biology.</p>

							<h2>Brainstorm</h2>
							<p>We had our first brainstorm, the organizer asked us to come up with fantastic ideas no matter if they are practical. At that time, we hardly knew anything about synthetic biology, but it did not bother us to have bats in the belfry.</p>

							<h2>Project review</h2>
							<p>We moved from Journal Club to Project Review. Each of us picked one iGem project in which he/she was interested and went over it in spare time. Still in Monday and Thursday, 6 students every time, we talked about the projects we chose and shared them. During this time, some students left us with various reasons, which is quite a pity.</p>

							<p>We had our second brainstorm. At that time we had the basic synthetic biology knowledge and our ideas were much more practical.</p>

							<h2>LGD</h2>
							<p>Our team had the first meeting. We classified the past software projects and discussed what we were going to do this year. These projects inspired us a lot and this meeting lasted for more than 4 hours with logical genetic designer (LGD) as the primary choice.</p>

							<h2>Eh...</h2>
							<p>the summer holiday started and so did our project. The last member, Yi Wan, recovered from pulmonary tuberculosis and joined us. First, we discussed and redefined our LGD, we want to make a CAD to modularize elements in genetic circuit and our advisor gave some precious comments. In order to achieve our goal, we decided to review the wet lab projects again. Then, we compared web page and native application and all agreed to adapt web2.0. (这一段一定要修改) Finally, we made a rule that everyone of us should do presentation at least once and the first pair is Xiaodan Zhu and Huiyu He.</p>
